# project heavenlyhades

Source code of simple applications.

## Directory structure

Code samples are (for now) grouped by programming language.

Ideally (to checkout code inside editor) a project inside a lang dir should be
able to cloned without issues.

i.e.

```cli
.
├── csharp
│  └── simple-api...............👈 should easily be opened in editors
│     ├── .gitignore
│     ├── SimpleApi
│     └── SimpleApi.sln
└── README.md ..................🗺️ you are here
```
